%DYPSA   Derive glottal closure instances and openings from speech
%   [gci,goi] = dypsa(s,fs) returns vectors gci and goi indicating samples

%   Revision History: 
%
%   2.6 - 29 Jun 2006  - Tidied up algorithm parameters
%   2.4 - 10 Jun 2006  - Made into a single file aand put into VOICEBOX
%   2.3 - 18 Mar 2005  - Removed 4kHz filtering of phase-slope function 
%   2.2 - 05 Oct 2004  -  dpgci uses the slopes returned from xewgrdel
%                      -  gdwav from speech with fs<9000 is not filtered
%                      -  Various outputs and inputs of functions have been
%                         removed since now there is no plotting

%   Bugs:  Allow the projections only to extend to the end of the larynx cycle
