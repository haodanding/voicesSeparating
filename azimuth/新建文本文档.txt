To select a pair of HRTF responses, we recommend using symmetrical responses obtained from one of the KEMAR ears. For instance, for the HRTF responses for a source 45 degrees to the right of the head at 0 degrees elevation, use ``L0e045a.dat'' for the left ear and ``L0e315a.dat'' for the right ear, or use ``R0e315a.dat'' for the left ear and ``R0e045a.dat'' for the right ear. Note that this approach eliminates binaural localization cues in the median plane.
